* The SLX file here is a prototype Simulink traction control algorithm developed by Paul Lea. 
* This is a PID based algorithm based that will hopefully be implemented into the MoTeC firmware for RM26 using the MoTeC built-in Simulink/Matlab/Motec Integration tools

* Currently trying to determine how to generate the C code from the SimuLink model.
  - I can't find the M1 Integration Tool that is mentioned in both Motec's documentation and MatLab's documentation.
  - I'm concerned that our school MatLab does not have the neccessary license for the M1 toolkit.
