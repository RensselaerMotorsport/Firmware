Notes on Requirements for Acceleration Pedal Position Sensors:
* There are two sensors required by rules for redundancy
* The sensors we use are Honeywell RTP hall-effect sensors. I don't remember what angle they max out at but it doesn't matter because the voltage bounds and calibration will be done in M1 Tune and not M1 Build (and we know it's enough, i.e. >=90 degrees).
* Minimum Sample Rate Required: 200Hz
