* Should I separate the ESC from the Motor tree structure (so it's standalone)?
* Should I also have a separate Accumulator tree substructure, or should I leave it under the Motor one?
  - What would fall under the accumulator substructure besides BMS?

* Should I just make parameters to hold the CAN information for things like vehicle states?

* May be worth looking into DBC files for easier control over CAN information.
