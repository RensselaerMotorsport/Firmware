General Notes:
* All of the function files will need to be updated to reflect the change in the enumeration names (given the change from "Engine" to "Motor"
* Need to learn how the ECU will interact with the ESC and how much data will actually go between them.
* Also need to research how much power draw the ESC will draw from the smaller 12V battery.
- We will already have a difficult time making sure all of the LV devices will have enough power, the ESC was not considered (as it should have been).
* I need to look into how the ECU interacts with the BMS also
- Assuming it is also CAN, simply because of how many sensors and how much data is being kept track of


Data Acquisition Logging Goal = 60 minutes of logging.

Emailed MoTeC Customer Service about VCU GPA Package
* They do not have a GPA example VCU firmware sadly.
* They also weren't able to give an answer about using the VCU option within the M1 Build software, will need to do our own testing to determine if it's possible. I still believe that it is.
