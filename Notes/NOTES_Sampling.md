1 Hz:

2 Hz:
* BMS? Need to look into if there are requirements for how often this needs to be polled

5 Hz:

10 Hz:
* Brake Rotor Temperature
* GPS
* Cooling

20 Hz:

50 Hz:

100 Hz:
* Brake Pressure (front and rear)
* 3-Axis Accelerometer (in-built to ECU and external one)
* Coolant Pressure (may be able to change this to lower, historically here)

200 Hz:
* Wheel Speed (4 corners)
* APPS
* Strain Gauges (need to check this, I believe this is the fastest possible due to CAN speed limits)

500 Hz:

1000 Hz:
* Shock Position Sensors (4 corners)
* Steering Column (if we run this, we should ideally)
